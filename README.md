# Overview

Very simple example including an App and a few tests (illustrating different testing styles).

# Running the app

    sbt run

# Running the tests

    sbt test

# Running a Scala console

This allows you to explore the functionality of the classes in this project in a Scala REPL
while letting sbt set the classpath for you.

    sbt console
